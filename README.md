# Taxi_Fare_Prediction

# Overview
This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict taxi fares based on a real-time dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation, resulting in the development of a machine learning pipeline.

# Objectives
Predict Taxi Fares: Accurately predict the fare for a given taxi ride using real-time data.  <br>
Data Preprocessing: Used statistical methods to handle missing values and clean the dataset. <br>
Feature Engineering: Extracted and created relevant features to enhance model performance. <br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to gain insights and understand data patterns. <br>
Model Training: Trained multiple models including XGBoost, polynomial regression, and decision tree. <br>
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearch to fine-tune the best-performing model. <br>
Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, F1 score, and a confusion matrix.
